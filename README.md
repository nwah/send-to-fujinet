Browser extension to mount disk images on your FujiNet device from your web browser

## Testing locally
### Chromium-based browsers
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Click "Load unpacked"
3. Navigate and select `chromium` folder in this repo
4. Extension should be active. May need to reload pages to test.
